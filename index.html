                My name is Sneha Rugmini, I am 19 years old. I am student, taking computer programming in Georgian College.
                I would graduate in 2024. My favorite colour is green and my favorite sport is volleyball. I love animals. I was born and
                brought up in United Arab Emirates and I have one
                younger sibling. My hobbies include mostly art. I love working with charcoal and acrylics mainly. I have done many works in the past and enjoy posting them on social media.
